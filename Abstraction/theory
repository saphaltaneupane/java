-----------Abstraction--------------
#process of hiding implementation  details in the programs.



#to achieve abstraction:
      a>Abstract class:
      class which contains abstract(unimplemented) methods and non-abstract (implemented) methods is known as abstract class
      #ABstract method:
      = method which doesnot have body/implementation
        e.g.
        abstract void add();
        abstract void print(String msg);

         jasko implementation child ma farak hunxa inherit garda sab aauca inheritance ma ta kunai chaneg garda bayo yesma ta override garnai paryo
     # every abstract class must have at least one child class ans child class must override abstract methods.
     #we cant create object of abstract class,
     #level of abstraction 0-100%
      syntax:
       abstract class class_name{
       //abstract methods
       // non-abstract methods
       }

        b>Interface:
               # same as class which contains public abstract methods and public static final(constants) variables is known as interface.

               #every interface must have at least one implementation class and implementation class must override
               abstract method
               #we cant create object of interface.
               #100%abstraction

               syntax:
               interface interface_name{
               // public abstract methods
               }
